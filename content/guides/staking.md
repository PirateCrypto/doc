## The Basics of Staking

### What is staking?
Crypto staking is the lending of cryptocurrencies to be used as collateral by [proof-of-stake (PoS)](#proof-of-stake-pos) blockchains to achieve a variety of outcomes, such as extending loans, validating network transactions, earning interest or gaining new crypto coins as rewards. Staking is most commonly used by Ethereum and its decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and is essentially gaining passive income much like interest accrued on an investment or savings account in traditional finance.

### How does it work?
The process of staking begins with you buying or receiving a stakable coin that uses the [proof-of-stake (PoS)](#proof-of-stake-pos) consensus mechanism. Upon obtaining, you then will either be required to lock your coin for a set amount of time, or you are already gaining staking.

The locking period depends upon the exchange or protocol you decide to stake under, as well as the coin you are staking. While some exchange's staking methods like [Crypto.com Earn](https://crypto.com/earn) require 30-180 day locking period, others like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/staking) don't require a lockup period at all. Although, the rewards for coins in a locked stake are generally higher than those that are unlocked or flexible.

After obtaining your coin and, if required, locking it in a stake, you are now eligble to gain staking rewards. These rewards are generally listed as Annual Percentage Yield or APY for short. Depending upon the coin and staking protocol, the rewards are either immediately distributed or after a particular time period, such as a week or a month.

## Proof of Stake (PoS)
![PoS](/guides/staking/pos.png)

### What is Proof of Stake (PoS)?
Proof of Stake (PoS) is a modification of PoW introduced in 2012 as a means to solve its perceived dependency on energy consumption as a means to determine blockchain ordering.

Rather than rely on computers racing to generate the appropriate hash, the idea behind a PoS protocol is that participation is determined by ownership of the coin supply.

### How does Proof of Stake (PoS) work?
Using a set of factors determined by the protocol, the PoS algorithm pseudo-randomly elects a node (anyone who owns the coin) to propose the next block to the blockchain. 

When a node gets elected, its role is to verify the validity of the transactions within the block, sign it and propose the block to the network for validation.

### How is the Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain ordered?
Similar to PoW, a PoS blockchain is a mechanism that consists of a string of blocks aligned in chronological order based on its transactions.

The first block in a PoS blockchain is also hardcoded into its software and is commonly named the genesis block. The subsequent blocks added to the blockchain always refer to the previous blocks and each contain a copy of the full, updated ledger.

Of note, in PoS cryptocurrencies, there is no competition for who is selected to add blocks. As such, the blocks are often said to be ‘forged’, or ‘minted’ rather than mined.

### What is the energy usage of Proof of Stake (PoS)?
Unlike PoW blockchains, PoS blockchains do not determine who can propose blocks based on energy consumption. Proponents often bill PoS as a “more efficient” system, as PoW miners have been known to use coal and other forms of fuel harmful to the environment.

That said, PoW miners can choose to use any energy source, including hydroelectric power, wind and other less wasteful forms of energy. 

Further, PoS blockchains also require the use of specialized hardware (GPUs) that, like PoW mining equipment (ASICs) and other computing devices, require resources to produce. 

PoS miners must also maintain active internet connections, which requires energy expense.

### How do I participate in Proof of Stake (PoS)?
Users who want the opportunity to be selected to add blocks to a PoS blockchain are required to stake, or lock, a certain amount of the blockchain’s cryptocurrency in a special contract. 

The amount of coins staked determines their chances to be selected as the next block producer. In some cases, if users behave maliciously, they may lose their stake as punishment. 

In order to not always favor the wealthiest nodes, PoS may involve other determining factors. These may include the amount of time a node has staked their coins, as well as pure randomization. 

### How are rewards distributed for Proof of Stake (PoS)?
Similar to the PoW algorithm, the block reward in PoS refers to cryptocurrency awarded by the blockchain to the user who proposes a valid block. 

However, as block selection is done by coin ownership, exchanges may offer staking services that offer users the ability to stake funds on their behalf in exchange for more regular payouts.

## The Two Types of Staking
![Types](/guides/staking/types.jpg)

### Decentralized Staking
Decentralized staking works by directly locking up tokens on a blockchain. Tokens can be staked, or locked inside the network, in exchange for the chance to produce a block, which in turn, you would receive a reward for. This is called Proof of Stake. This method of block production is fundamentally different from how the bitcoin network operates.

Just like with Bitcoin, there is a reward for producing the next block. This is how the annual rate of return is calculated. The rate of return is an estimate though, as it can fluctuate by quite a lot depending on how much others lock up for staking purposes.

Perhaps the project that is getting the most attention on the proof of stake front, is Ethereum. Ethereum is currently a proof of work blockchain. The blockchain is transitioning to proof of stake, meaning anyone can participate in block production, simply by locking up some ETH. Staking will be available after the launch of [Ethereum 2.0](https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/ethereum-2/faq/).

### Centralized Staking (Lending)
The main difference between lending and staking, is that you give up direct access to your funds, often to earn a higher rate of return. Various lending services such as [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/), [Nexo](https://nexo.io/), or [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) connect lenders with borrowers, and earn their margins in between. You deposit your funds into their custodial wallet, and earn an agreed-upon rate of return. Most times, these services make you lock up your cryptocurrency for a predetermined amount of time.

With lending, you are not restricted by the blockchain needing to be proof of stake. You can lend any asset that the lending services wants to offer to borrowers. This is a major perk of lending out your assets. For example, you may be very bullish on bitcoin, and want to earn interest on the base amount of bitcoin you own. You won’t be able to do this in a decentralized fashion, as bitcoin is not proof of stake. You may however, choose to revoke your access to the bitcoin to a lender, that will give you a guaranteed rate of return. Be careful though, if a rate seems too good to be true, it probably is. Make sure you check the legitimacy, and reputation of the lender, before depositing your assets on their services. For example, Crypto.com has insurance in case of loss of funds, or a hack. Therefore, they might be a sensible choice for a lending provider.

## What are the advantages and risks of staking?

### Advantages
Many long-term crypto holders look at staking as a way of making their assets work for them by generating rewards, rather than collecting dust in their crypto wallets.

Staking has the added benefit of contributing to the security and efficiency of the blockchain projects you support. By staking some of your funds, you make the blockchain more resistant to attacks and strengthen its ability to process transactions. (Some projects also award “governance tokens” to staking participants, which give holders a say in future changes and upgrades to that protocol.)

### Risks
Staking often requires a lockup or “vesting” period, where your crypto can’t be transferred for a certain period of time. This can be a drawback, as you won’t be able to trade staked tokens during this period even if prices shift. Before staking, it is important to research the specific staking requirements and rules for each project you are looking to get involved with.

## How do I start staking?

### How to stake on Coinbase
Coinbase staking is a great starting point for newcomers as it is available to almost everyone and there is no lockup or vesting period.

**1. Choose a coin to stake.**

| Coin       |   | APY                   |
| ---------- | - | --------------------- |
| USD Coin   |   | 0.15% APY - 5.00% APY |
| Dai        |   | 2.00% APY             |
| Tezos      |   | 4.63% APY             |
| Algorand   |   | 4.00% APY             |
| Cosmos     |   | 5.00% APY             |
| Ethereum 2 |   | 5.00% APY             |

*Note that Ethereum 2 (ETH2) staking on Coinbase will involve a locking period until Ethereum 2 is released.*

**2. Purchase or obtain the coin you want to stake.**

For the sake of this guide, let's say you purchase $100.00 USD worth of Cosmos at $10.00 per coin; that's 10 ATOM total. Coinbase does not have a locking or vesting period for staking Cosmos, so you are already gaining rewards for holding it! That means you technically are already staking your coin as long as you are holding at least the required amount to gain rewards. The minimum balance for each coin on Coinbase to stake is shown below.

| Coin       |   | Minimum Balance      |
| ---------- | - | -------------------- |
| USD Coin   |   | $1.00 USD Equivalent |
| Dai        |   | $1.00 USD Equivalent |
| Tezos      |   | 1.00 XTZ             |
| Algorand   |   | 0.01 ALGO            |
| Cosmos     |   | 1.00 ATOM            |
| Ethereum 2 |   | No minimum balance   |

This is how most coins stake on Coinbase, with the exception of Ethereum 2, in which is locked until Ethereum 2 is realeased.

**3. Receive rewards for the coins you hold.**

Currently, on Coinbase, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for Cosmos is 5.00% APY. This means, that within a full year of staking, you will gain 5.00% of the 10 ATOM that you purchased, which is 0.5 ATOM total.

When holding the required amount of a stakable coin on Coinbase, you are already gaining rewards. However, they each are dispersed at a different time, depending upon that coin's staking protocol. The rewards payout rates for each coin on Coinbase to stake is shown below.

| Coin       |   | Reward Payout        |
| ---------- | - | -------------------- |
| USD Coin   |   | 1 Month              |
| Dai        |   | 1 Day                |
| Tezos      |   | 3 Days               |
| Algorand   |   | 1 Day                |
| Cosmos     |   | 7 Days               |
| Ethereum 2 |   | 1 Day                |

So, after 7 days, you will receive the first rewards from your staked Cosmos, which will be credited directly into your Coinbase Cosmos balance. Congratulations, you just staked a coin on Coinbase!
