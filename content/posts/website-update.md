I am currently in the process of updating the main website using [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme. This itself is a project that I'll be learning from as well, although it has nothing to do with Cryptocurrency. 

As always, the source is up on GitHub and can be seen [on GitHub](https://github.com/PirateCrypto/tps-website/).

If you have any suggestions on how the website can be made better, feel free to contact me through GitHub or just create an issue on the main repository.
